# Mighty Robots

Welcome everyone :D  

This is our mighty robots repository that we will use to create our awesome bots to win the upcoming battle >:D  

Let's build the best and strongest bots so no one can stand in our way *evil laugh*  


## Setup
I personally prefer intellij but you can use eclipse if you want. (just email me if you want my help with this)  

So, first you need to get the robocode jar from https://sourceforge.net/projects/robocode/files/ download the jar then run it. This will install the basic setup for robocode.

Navigate to where robocode has been installed. Run robocode.sh (this will start our battle field)

After cloning this repo, open the project and make sure you include the robocode.jar (can be found in the installed robocode dirctory in libs) in the project. For example in intellij, got to File -> Project Structure -> Libraries then click + and choose Java and navigate to robocode/libs and add the jar.

With this you can now build the project. In intellij, Build -> Build Project.

Then, go to the battle field window (after running robocode.sh). Go to Options -> Preferences -> Development Options -> Add. naviagte to where you cloned this project and then to mighty_robots/out/production then select mighty_robots and click choose.

Now Go to Battle -> New, you should see fighters package and Destroyer robot and select then for the battle ;D
